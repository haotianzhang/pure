ptrace_signal testcase is based on the defect WIND00291859. In the WIND00291859, process gets signal with wrong sequence.



Target process will fork a child process, this child process will set two signal actions (SIGSTOP and  SIGTRAP), then go to sleep forever.

ptrace_sig process will do the follow steps :
1. Attach the child target process. 
2. Wait the child target process stopped. When the child target process stopped, get the signal number.
3. Call the ptrace with PTRACE_SYSCALL argument, the ptrace function will restart the child target process.
4. Wait the child target process stopped.  When the child target process stopped, get the signal number.
5. Detach the child target process.


The child target process should accept a SIGSTOP and a SIGTRAP signal. repeat "loop" times
The runtest.sh will check the sequence of signals that child target process accepted.
If it gets wrong sequence signals, it will exit with 1. otherwise exit with 0
