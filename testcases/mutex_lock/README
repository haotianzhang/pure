The mutex_lock testcase is based on the WIND00279094. 
When using the mutex lock in the preempt_rt, the load of cpu will go up from 60% to 100%



Test steps
1. Run the mutex_lock1 and mutex_lock2 in the background.
2. wait for 2 minutes.
3. check if the CPU usage is go up to near 80%.
4. if usage is bigger than 80%, exit with 1, otherwise exit with 0.
